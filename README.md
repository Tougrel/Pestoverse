Welcome to the **Pestoverse** github repo! The official community website built for Yuniiho's community to celebrate milestones and archive them so we can go back and watch/read them!

The website currently only has an interactive map with markers that show images of pesto plushies around the world! We are planning on adding more stuff in the future!

Credits will be given to all pesties that help (even with bug fixing and ideas)!

> This is a community project! If you want to contribute feel free to fork the repo and open a pull request.

## How to run the website

```bash
# We are using yarn as a package manager but you can use whatever you want
# Make sure to install the dependencies:
yarn install

# Once you install the dependencies you can start a development server using
yarn dev
# This will start a dev server on http://localhost:3000

# To test the application locally you can run
yarn preview
```
